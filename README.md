# Hi! I'm Michael üëã

Hi! I'm Michael, and I'm a 3rd year BS/MS CS student at Georgia Tech üêù. I love low-level systems and backend engineering. I enjoy writing in Java, C/C++, Python, and Go; I'm also heavily experienced with frameworks like Spring Framework, Kafka, and gRPC.

## Notable Projects

See my pinned projects, the [Hackathons](#hackathons) section, and my [portfolio](https://michael-yi.com/portfolio). The following are projects that are closed-source (if any future employers would like to see their code, please contact me at michaelyi@gatech.edu):

- **OS Kernel Components**: Virtual memory, page tables, page faults, a multi-core CPU scheduler, & a reliable transport protocol.
- **Sales Invoice Automation Platform**: A platform for a logistics company that generates pivot tables and bills invoices from Excel sales data. Wrote a custom API gateway to distribute GraphQL requests to microservices with Java, Spring, gRPC, Kafka.
